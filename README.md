# Germany---COVID-19

The repository contains information related to the Achievement 6 from the Career Foundry course in Data Analytics.

For this project, I selected a dataset containing detailed information about the diffusion of SARS-COV2 virus in Germany. I currently live in Germany, and since COVID-19 has made the headlines in all news since its discovery in 2019, I thought that it could be more than appropriate for me to explore it in this project.

#### Main data preparation steps:
